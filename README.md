#[OpenAdmin](/post.php?post=openadmin.txt)
OpenAdmin is a simple app to give you root privileges when opening some apps. 

I made this app because I often need to open some apps with extra privileges. i.e.: Activity Monitor to see applications that are running with higher privilege than my current user.

The image on the left was opened with OpenAdmin and the image on the right was opened by just double clicking the icon. 

Notice the difference?

The image on the left allows you to view processes owned by root.
